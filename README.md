Data Validation API Resources
===

Welcome fellow validators. This is our public GitHub repository where you can find 
all the latest Documentation, Code Samples, and other interesting resources. 

To receive a free test API key and access our API Console for the ability to try our API 
without writing a single line of code go to : http://datavalidation.com/apigo/

Once you have done that stay tuned to our GitHub page for more developer resources. 

P.S. 
====
If you have implemented our API and would like to submit code samples to help your fellow
GitHubers' we would greatly appreciate it.
